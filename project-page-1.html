                    Above is a screenshot of the CMS design using HTML and CSS. This is my first time experimenting with forms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I wanted the title, date and author inputs to be the first thing the user enters and I wanted to use the placeholder text to prompt the user. I decided to use a table to display these elements.
                </p>
                <br>
                <P>
                    Next, I wanted to keep the text options and the blog content together and make it obvious for the user by putting it in a purple block.
                </P> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    For the text and backgound colors, the user has a wide range of options with the color picker. I know that people have very specific color themes on their pages so it's good to give them the option of entering their RGB codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user also has the option to upload a cover image to go with their blog to engage the reader.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Preview button is meant to preview their blog on their website and make formatting changes as they see necessary to increase readability and engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the user can input their SEO data after their article is written.
