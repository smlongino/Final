                <p>
                    Above is a screenshot of the CMS design using HTML and CSS. This is my first time experimenting with forms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I wanted the title, date and author inputs to be the first thing the user enters and I wanted to use the placeholder text to prompt the user. I decided to use a table to display these elements.
                </p>
                <br>
                <P>
                    Next, I wanted to keep the text options and the blog content together and make it obvious for the user by putting it in a block with a different color background.
                </P> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    For the text and backgound colors, the user has a wide range of options with the color picker. I know that people have very specific color themes on their pages so it's good to give them the option of entering their RGB codes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The user also has the option to upload a cover image to go with their blog to engage the reader.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Preview button is meant to preview their blog on their website and make formatting changes as they see necessary to increase readability and engagement.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Finally, the user can input their SEO data after their article is written. This is also in a table.
                </p>
                <br>
                <P>
                    I added some padding around the tables and adjusted the table row height and table data width to increase readability.
                </P>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When I finally got the content laid out how I wanted, it was the fisrt day of summer and the first sunny day in a while in Seattle, so I wanted to add a bright background to match my mood! And it makes blogging more fun of course.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Next I started experimenting with Javasdcript in order to add funationality to the Preview button. I had some issues with getting this to work at first until I realized some of my ID's in my JS code did not match (uppercase vs lowercase letters). Now I know to always copy and paste! Now when the user click the button, they can see what the post will look like.</p>

                <image src="Images/JS_screenshot.png" alt="content management system" style="width:900px" class="center"> </image>
                <br>
                <p>My next challenge is to add funationality to the text formatting buttons for text color, background color and font style.</p>
